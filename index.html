      <div class="description">
        A pilot stranded in the desert awakes one morning to see, standing before him, the most
        extraordinary little fellow. "Please," asks the stranger, "draw me a sheep." And the pilot realizes that when
        life's
        events are too difficult to understand, there is no choice but to succumb to their mysteries. He pulls out
        pencil and
        paper... And thus begins this wise and enchanting fable that, in teaching the secret of what is really important
        in
        life, has changed forever the world for its readers.
